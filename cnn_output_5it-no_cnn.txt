EFTFitter is initialized with mode hybrid, event statistics counted as xsec...
Expecting as data a template with key data...

EFTFitter: iteration 0 starting...
EFTFitter: starting fit on variable b1k in iteration 0
Adding input with key cnn_0 of type all...

Adding input with key cnn_1 of type all...

Adding input with key cnn_-1 of type all...

Preparing the base contents for all operators...
Contribution of each operator at 1 (in xsec) is:
[ [ cnn :: linear ] :: -0.333333, 0 ]
[ [ cnn :: quadratic ] :: 1.21431e-16, 0 ]
For reference: SM xsec is -0.06626, 0

Assigning key cnn_0 of type linear as data...
Note: previous data is overwritten by this method!!
